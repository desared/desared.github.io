<h4><em>Projects</em></h4><br/><br/>

<b><a>1. Conceptualization and Development of a Predictive Big Data Streaming Application in the Context of Automotive Manufacturing (Master Thesis Project-ongoing)</a></b><br/><br/>
A well-defined, efficient and scalable technique which deals with big data at high velocity will be developed. The principles of Lambda application will be implemented and compared with pure batch or stream processing.
More specifically, an application predicting potential anomalies on big data streams will be developed. Such an application will run on a predefined architecture, which will be optimized in the context of automotive manufacturing. It must cover an end-to-end framework, including all the necessary stages dealing with data sourcing, ingestion, processing, model training, prediction, scoring and visualization.
For evaluation and testing purposes, data resources and infrastructure provided by AUDI AG will be used.<br/> <br/>

<b><a href="https://github.com/desared/Analysis-and-Prediction-on-Movies">2. Analysis and Prediction on Movies (Lab Project)</a></b><br/><br/>
This project is presented at Fraunhofer Institute in the scope of RWTH lab. The topic consists on movie predictions using multivariate regression and feature modelling. The application is built using R environment for computing and graphics.
The research question addressed in this analysis is this:<br/>
• Is there any correlations between movie general features that make people like or dislike a movie?<br/>
More specifically, do variables such as movie genre, MPAA rating, run length, etc. work as reasonable
predictors of a movie’s popularity? Can we predict the rating of a movie based on these components?
Predicting which movies are likely to be popular ahead of their release would be valuable information when
deciding which movies to watch. Moreover, companies such as Netflix do such an analysis to predict wich
movies are mostly preferable in specific seasons.<br/> <br/>

<b><a href="https://github.com/desared/Multiplayer-Dice-Game">3. Multiplayer Dice Game (Computer Science Bachelor Thesis)</a></b><br/><br/>

Complex game using advanced algorithm and probabilistic functions. I managed to present it as a senior thesis in Computer Science in May 2015. It is constructed and built in Java IDE. 
This game is a modified version of one of my favorite childhood dice games, Ludo Game. The purpose of the game is to give different players the possibility to try their abilities and luck against each other. This game is highly interactive and can be played by anyone who is trying to spend some joyful time in the companionship of his/her friends. To be more specific, it is a simple game if you follow specific rules that will be explained below. All you need is time, luck and positive attitude. After all, the intention of this game is to offer pleasure to players and the player’s aim is to be the first one in the finish line. 
<br/> <br/>
<b><a>4. Tour Guide Mobile Application – Android Application (Information Systems Bachelor Thesis)</a></b><br/><br/>

Interactive Android application containing a relatively huge database of European touristic destinations. I presented it on May 2015 as a senior thesis in Information Systems. 
The main focus of this project is to create a tour guide application, which will help the users (mainly tourists) to choose the most appropriate place to visit in the Balkan Peninsula. There will be detailed information for 6 cities in that region. Many functionalities work independently from each other and are unique. The information is stored locally. Every button is built to do a simple task. Bright colors, photos, maps and plenty of detailed information will help the users to create a sense of continuity when going from one country to the other.<br/> <br/>

<h4><em>Papers</em></h4><br/><br/>

<b><a href="https://www.overleaf.com/articles/sparql-query-optimization-for-federated-linked-data/mhrfhbgmdctk#.WunR0YiFNPZ">1. SPARQL Query Optimization for Federated Linked Data (Seminar Paper)</a></b><br/><br/>
The Web has evolved from a system of internet servers supporting formatted documents into a web of linked data. 
In the last years, the Web of Data is constantly growing. Consequently, it has developed a large collection of interlinked data sets from multiple domains. 
To exploit the diversity of all available data, federated queries are needed. However, many problems such as processing power, query response time, high workload or outdated information are hindering the query processing. In this paper, I am aiming to explain various optimization techniques which have the potential to lead a significant improvement on the final query runtime. I will start by briefly introducing recent approaches of federation and show why SPARQL federation endpoints are mostly in my focus. Specifically, I will compare state-of-the-art SPARQL query federation engines and analyze respective optimization approaches. The main federation engines I will analyze in terms of query optimization are FedX, DARQ and SPLENDID. As the result I provide concrete examples and conclude which of the engines has the best performance based on the query execution time as key criterion.  <br/> <br/>

<b><a href="https://www.overleaf.com/articles/an-overview-of-visualization-in-mathematics-programming-and-big-data/tytdbzqvbvrh#.WunRvIiFNPZ">2. An Overview of Visualization in Mathematics, Programming and Big Data (Seminar Paper)</a></b><br/><br/>

Visualization is a descriptive way to ensure the audience attention and to make people better understand the content of a given topic.
Nowadays, in the world of science and technology, visualization has become a necessity.
However, it is a huge challenge to visualize varying amounts of data in a static or dynamic form.
In this paper we describe the role, value and importance of visualization in maths and science.
In particular, we are going to explain in details the benefits and shortages of visualization in three main domains: Mathematics, Programming and Big Data.
Moreover, we show the future challenges of visualization and our perspective how to better approach and face with the recent problems through technical solutions.  <br/> <br/>
