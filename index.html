&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Without data, you are just another person with an opinion!</i>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to my personal webpage. My name is Desared Osmanllari, a young and passionate data scientist who is eager to learn and work with the latest discoveries concerning Big Data, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. 
I am graduated from RWTH Aachen University with a master degree in Software Systems Engineering. Currently, I am working as a data scientist by real.digital, an e-commerce company located in Cologne. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, I have completed my bachelor degree in Computer Science and Information Systems from the American University in Bulgaria. During my bachelor studies, I was awarded Cum Laude and received Phi Beta Delta honorary price for my international experiences. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding my previous experiences in RWTH, I have worked as a student helper by the Advanced Community Information Systems group and as a teaching assistant by the Big Data & Model Management group. <br/>
Furthermore, I have attended two internships in the area of Data Science. The first internship was offered by PwC Deutschland in the field of Forensic Technology Solutions & Data Mining, while the second one was supervised by AUDI AG in the domain of Big Data and Machine Learning.
Onward, I worked my master thesis in cooperation with AUDI AG and RWTH Aachen. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides studies, my daily routine is mainly focused to my friends, personal projects, football and fitness. Another hobby of mine is travelling because it exposes you to unique cultures, different people, various ways of living, and opens your mind to better undestand the world.
