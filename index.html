&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to my personal webpage. I am Desared Osmanllari, a graduate student of Software Systems Engineering in RWTH Aachen University. The field of studies where I am specialized and have passion for is Data Science. More specifically, I am eager to learn and work with the latest discoveries concerning the field of Big Data and Machine Learning. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am graduated from the American University in Bulgaria with a double bachelor degree in Computer Science and Information Systems. During my bachelor studies, I was awarded Cum Laude and received Phi Beta Delta honorary price for my international experiences. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding my experiences in RWTH Aachen, I have worked as a student helper by the Advanced Community Information Systems group and as a teaching assistant by the Big Data & Model Management group. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I have attended two internships in the area of Data Science. The first internship was offered by PwC Deutschland in the field of Forensic Technology Solutions & Data Mining, while the second one was supervised by AUDI AG in the domain of Big Data and Machine Learning.
Currently, I am writing my master thesis in cooperation with AUDI AG and RWTH Aachen. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides studies, my daily routine is mainly focused to my friends, personal projects, football and fitness. One of my hobbies is travelling because it exposes you to unique cultures, different people, various ways of living, and opens your mind to better undestand the world.
