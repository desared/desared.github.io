I am Desared Osmanllari, a graduate student of Software Systems Engineering in RWTH Aachen. The field of studies where I am specialized is Data Science. <br/><br/>
I am graduated from the American University in Bulgaria with a double bachelor degree in Computer Science and Information Systems. During my bachelor studies, I was awarded Cum Laude and received Phi Beta Delta honorary price for my international experiences. <br/><br/>
Regarding my experiences in RWTH Aachen, I have worked as a student helper by the Advanced Community Information Systems group and as a teaching assistant by the Big Data & Model Management group. <br/><br/>
Furthermore, I have attended two internships in the area of Data Science. The first internship was offered by PwC Deutschland in the field of Forensic Technology Solutions & Data Mining, while the second one was supervised by AUDI AG in the domain of Big Data and Machine Learning.
Currently, I am writing my master thesis in cooperation with AUDI AG and RWTH Aachen. <br/><br/>
Besides studies, my daily routine is mainly focused to my friends, personal projects, football and fitness.
